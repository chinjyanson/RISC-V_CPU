# RISC V (Team 1) 

This repository is part of an IAC Module for Imperial where we are required to design a single cycle processor, and then further designing a pipelined processor (with data memory cache and hazard unit).

## High Level Description

- Design a single cycle processor that runs 2-3 instructions on ...
