# Chin Jun Yen (Anson) Personal Statement 

## Single Cycle Processor 

### Introduction
I was primarily tasked with figuring out most of the ALU and RegFile operations, I occasionally worked with Bruno to figure out the appropriate logic between Control Unit.

We initially started slower than planned but our teamwork improved throughout the course of this project. 

### ALU 
For the ALU section, I implemented _ arithmetic functions 

implementing its arithmetic functions. I included 

### Register File
First thing I did was to break the Instr out via bitwise manipulation. Then I built a 256 x 32 Register file which is primarily used for storing data and intermediate values during computation. 

### Control Unit 



### F1 Assembly Code 



### Debugging 
I helped 

### Miscellaneous Contributions

## Summary
To wrap up a great term so far, I am really happy with what I have learnt in this module, including learning how to balance the dynamic of our group and
