# Bruno Duaso Personal Statement

## Single Cycle Processor

For this first section of the project, I was mainly involved in the Control Section, with special focus on the Control Unit instructions and the Sign Extender. I additionally 
was significantly involved in debugging and helped with some miscellaneous tasks.
In this section of the project, progress was slower than anticipated due to a series of 
unexpected challenges. The need for extensive debugging of various errors 
significantly impeded our ability to advance at the desired pace.

### Control Unit 
Most of the implementations in this module required a very complete knowledge of 
the CPU behaviour. To implement most of the instructions I was required to modify 
modules from PC and ALU. Samuel (SamuelKhoo2003) helped with the completion 
of this module.
Basic instructions (BNE, ADDI) where already implemented in the Lab 4 - A Reduced 
RISC-V CPU. In total, I implemented:
