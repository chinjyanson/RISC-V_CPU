# Chin Jun Yen (Anson) Personal Statement 

## Single Cycle Processor 

### Introduction
I was primarily tasked with figuring out most of the ALU and RegFile operations, I occasionally worked with Bruno (duasob) to figure out the appropriate logic between Control Unit.

We initially started slower than planned but our teamwork improved throughout the course of this project. 

### ALU 
For the ALU section, I implemented 7 arithmetic functions to perform ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR ,SLL, SRL and of course their respective immediate operations

There is also a line to check if the two inputs to the ALU is the same denoted by the output Zero
```
assign Zero = (SrcA == SrcB)
```

### Register File
First thing I did was to break the Instr out via bitwise manipulation. Then I built a 256 x 32 Register file which is primarily used for storing data and intermediate values during computation. 

### Control Unit 



### F1 Assembly Code 
I helped implement the instruction memory through setting up the Makefile provided in the project brief. 


### Debugging
